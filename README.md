#Markov - markov chain text generator

Have you ever wanted to see what it would look like to amalgamate every essay you've written written at University and generate something new from it? Wouldn't the works of Shakespeare benefit from an infusion of Judith Butler's thoughts on gender as a social construct?

Markov uses markov chain functionality to create a probability-based essay. Give it a try!

(_still a work in progress - not currently functional_)

#Running

Add a text file to the Markov directory, consisting of the text you'd like to be used.

#Compilation

It's written in C++, with an included makefile. Use "make" and "make clean" to compile and rm compilation files, respectively.
